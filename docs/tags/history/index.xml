      <description>What did Earth look like when humans migrated to the Americas? Changing sea levels and large ice sheets during the last ice age played a key role in human migration and explain many archaeological sites now buried under the sea.
I wanted a better way to visualize how geography shaped our history. So I built an interactive historical model of Earth, covering the last 100,000 years. It includes elevation, rising sea levels, changing climate and moving ice sheets.</description>
