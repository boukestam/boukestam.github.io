      <description>ChatGPT is a website where you can chat with a smart AI. It has seen huge growth to over 100 million users in just a few months, becoming the fastest growing technology ever. It has sparked many questions and discussions, including what the impact on our jobs will be. In this article I will try to explain this and give some examples to show what it can do.
A short introduction    Large language models have been in development for several decades, but it really started to ramp up in the past few years with a model called a &amp;ldquo;transformer&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>AI systems are becoming more advanced at an ever increasing pace. At some point these programs are going to be so good that we might start to wonder if they are alive. But how will we know? And what does it even mean to be alive, or conscious?

      <description>The heuristic imperatives are a set of rules designed by David Shapiro and aim to align autonomous AI agents towards a positive future for humanity. The imperatives are:
 Reduce suffering Increase prosperity Increase understanding  In the examples below I will try to convince you that the heuristic imperatives can lead to the AI deciding to reduce freedom/independence in order to optimise the imperatives. I will also propose a possible solution to this by adding a fourth imperative.</description>
