      <description>AI systems are becoming more advanced at an ever increasing pace. At some point these programs are going to be so good that we might start to wonder if they are alive. But how will we know? And what does it even mean to be alive, or conscious?

I will also propose a possible solution to this by adding a fourth imperative.</description>
