      <description>Introduction    In this post I will explain how I built an interactive historical model of earth. Why did I do this? I wanted to make a good way to visualise how geography played a role in human history. The shifting sea levels and large ice sheets during the last ice age explain human migration to the americas and archeological finds under the sea.
The model that I built covers the last 100,000 years and includes elevation, rising sea levels, changing climate and ice sheets.</description>
