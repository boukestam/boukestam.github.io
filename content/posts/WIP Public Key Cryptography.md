Each ethereum client and account identifies itself using a public key.
The public key is a unique sequence of bytes, usually displayed in hex format (0xf10ddd782c073D5644353a125F846E6Fc78ea235).
Each public key is created from a private key, which is kept secret. 
So how can we create a private and public key and how do they work?
