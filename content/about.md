I believe the best way to see if you understand something is to try and explain is as simple as possible.
Things I'm very interested in and like working and experimenting with:

- Blockchain protocols and cryptography (Ethereum)
- Artificial general intelligence
- Mapping technology and visualisation (OpenStreetMap)
- 3D rendering
- Automated trading strategy simulation and testing
